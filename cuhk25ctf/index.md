Iam Mr. Cow or Mr. Cloud?

Out on the edge of the pasture, a ladder climbs into the sky. At the top sits a quiet vault of silver—guarded by two peculiar doormen:

Mr. Cow, who lets you peek inside but never touch.

Mr. Cloud, who lets you take exactly one thing—if he believes who you are.

A tiny storefront page is all you’re given. It looks harmless, but it reflects the sky and whispers just enough about the rules above. In this realm, names matter more than keys. Those who shape their identity with care will earn a glance… and, with the right guise, the right to claim the treasure.
